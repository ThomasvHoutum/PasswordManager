# PasswordManager
An alt account password manager for game clients

Tip: Make a shortcut of the application and add it to your machine's startup folder.

# How to get started:
Run the application
Look in your system tray (expand by clicking the arrow in the bottom right)
Click on the application with no icon (I am lazy and won't add one)
Click "Add"

The "Client Name" field is very specific, it is the title of the window. To figure out the title, open the application of choice and hover over it on the taskbar. THat is the window title and should be filled in there.

Then simply fill in your login details and hit "Save".

Then the next time you focus on the client you have a saved login for, a popup will appear where you can copy the details.

# Warning
Fair warning, there is encryption on the login details, but it is not great :)
